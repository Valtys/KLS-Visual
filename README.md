Here is a tool that allows you to perform RedEngine file checks on a PC. It is very easy to use and certified 100% secure (I specify that if you have a total virus score it is due to the sending of the result data to a webhook)

To use it is very simple, just run it and wait for the script to scan your files for RedEngine files and if it finds files, a text will be marked with the address where the files in question are located.

If you want to do a check before testing it :
